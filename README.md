Group 7's practice page



Hey Guys, Here is our practice page to perfect our skills with HTML and CSS.


I vote that we start by creating a BIO page for each one of us. I will create a main page (just a basic one), and then you guys can add in your pages. 

For the sake of learning, lets also use lots of comments ( #THIS WAY WE CAN LOOK AT EACHOTHERS WORK AND SEE WHY SOME THINGS WORK, AND OTHERS DONT ).


The BIO page should have
  *A picture of you
  *links to your contact information
  *your information
  *and your hobby(s)
  plus anything else you care to add
  
Once you have done that add your own css stylesheet. We will combine them later.

Good Luck Guys!
